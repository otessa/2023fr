## Navigating Forj {-}
Forj is the Congress virtual platform, where you will find links to all Zoom sessions. Panelists and speakers and attendees will need to sign in to the platform and navigate to their event.



There are three ways to do this.

1. Follow the link from the **OTESSA Program**
2. From the Congress Homepage, go to the **Your Sessions / Open events** tab  
3. From the Congress Homepage, go to the **Associations tab**   

### **OPTION 1** {-}

In the bottom corner of each session on the [OTESSA Program page](https://otessa.org/2022/program), there is a 'Session Link', which will take you to the Events listing page in the Congress virtual platform. You may need to sign in.

Each session contains the same link to the events listing page, so if you don't see one, pick another!

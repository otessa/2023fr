<h4 id="metaphors-of-ed-tech">Metaphors of Ed Tech</h4>
<p><em>Martin Weller</em></p>
<p>In this talk, I will explore why metaphors are both a useful and
potentially misleading way of thinking about educational technology. A
number of metaphors will be proposed and analysed which demonstrate how
metaphors can shape our thinking and help us view educational technology
from different perspectives. The Covid pandemic saw nearly all education
institutions engaging in an online pivot, which usually involved online
versions of existing practices, such as lectures. As we seek to build on
this experience and offer a richer online experience it has become
evident that the face-to-face lecture has become a dominant model that
many struggle to see past. This talk will examine how different
metaphors can help us approach educational technology.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>The acceleration of digitalization, of automation and of
cyber-physical systems, the web3.0, the gig economy, the climate change
crisis, the demographic changes, the investment in green and renewable
technologies and the extended lifespans, to name only few disruptive
events, are reshaping the social and work-related skills we need and the
way we acquire them. When COVID-19 hit, we were reminded that we were
all interconnected and that educational transformation will never happen
if the stakeholders remain in their own bubbles. The pandemic
accentuated the urgency to rethink the role of higher education within
the learning ecosystem to answer the needs of today and tomorrow’s
learners, namely those who are left behind by the systems. In this
presentation I’m calling for action to break silos and incite,
strengthen, and sustain partnerships between all actors to support and
enable our learning societies and to ensure, together, the sustainable
change we need, especially if we decide to realize the vision of Society
5.0, a people-centric society with a sustainable, inclusive
socio-economic system.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> AI, re-thinking universities,
micro-credentials, prior learning recognition, mentoring,
partnerships</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>The closure of universities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March
2020 has exacerbated many challenges. In addition to the devastating
loss of revenue due to the absence of students on campus, criticisms of
traditional testing, content relevance, equity, diversity and inclusion,
the skills gap between what graduates offer and what employers are
looking for brings new layers to the crisis. These issues must be
overcome so that a diverse population of students can be better prepared
for the increasingly demanding and complex job market caused by major
technological disruptions as the world enters the age of AI and the 4th
Industrial Revolution. More than ever, universities need to rethink the
concept of learning experiences and learning spaces and provide
opportunities for lifelong learning so that intellectual exchanges can
take place both among students as peers and between students and
extra-academic actors to bring greater relevance to what students learn
through the curriculum. In this presentation, I will discuss the concept
of an alternative university that rests on four pillars:
micro-credentials, prior learning recognition, mentoring, and
partnerships.</p>

<p><em>Melissa Bishop</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> language revival, Indigenous, elder,
digital technology, computer-assisted language learning, guarded
optimism, FNMI</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Elders are held in high regard in First Nations, Metis, and Inuit
(FNMI) communities. They are the intergenerational transmitters of
ancestral language and Indigenous knowledge. Without language revival
initiatives, ancestral languages in FNMI communities are at risk of
extinction. Leveraging digital technologies while collaborating with
Elders can support revival initiatives. Through semi-structured
interviews and qualitative analysis, this study addresses how three
Elders who use technology in their ancestral language teaching (1)
describe the benefits, drawbacks, and preferences of technology; (2)
reveal the accuracy with which cultural knowledge is imparted through
technology; and (3) view the impact of technology on their role as
traditional knowledge keepers and intergenerational language
transmitters? Findings suggest that while Elders acknowledge the
benefits when leveraging digital tools in language revival initiatives,
they have concerns about technology’s potential negative impacts on
relationality [culture, spirituality, and medicine practices], a concept
I have termed guarded optimism.</p>

<p>In this session, we will share a project conducted at [school name
removed for review] in the [district name removed for review], which is
in Northern British Columbia, Canada. Three highschool teachers from
different disciplines (Social Studies, Digital Media, and Carpentry)
launched a cross-curricular inquiry-based project, focusing on truth and
reconciliation, that connected the learners in their highschool and the
broader community, including knowledge holders from the local Indigenous
communities. Those engaged in the project examined questions around what
truth and reconciliation meant to the learners and its significance.
Resulting products included a legacy wall containing individual learning
represented in motifs, design of the feather using wood from around the
world, and a video documentary containing interviews from school and
community stakeholders. We will screen clips of videos during our
session, but invite participants to pre-screen the two videos
(Documentary Parts 1 and 2), which can be accessed on our YouTube
playlist, where a process video and a reflection video are also
available.</p>

<p><em>Bonnie Stewart (University of Windsor), Samatha Szcyrek
(University of Windsor)</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> data, datafication, data literacy, data
ethics, higher education</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Over recent decades, higher education infrastructures have become
increasingly digitized and datafied. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated
adoption of online learning platforms, trading the walls of the
classroom for digital systems. Yet the surveillance, privacy, and
security issues that such systems raise are minimally understood by
those who teach and learn within them. This presentation overviews a
2020 pilot survey and 2021-22 qualitative study of higher education
instructors from different parts of the globe. These projects explored
the ways in which instructors from various locales and academic status
positions understand data and classroom tools; the presentation draws on
those studies to frame concerns about datafication amplifying inequity
in higher education. Its premises are twofold: first, if higher
education instructors, as knowledge workers, are not knowledgeable about
the contexts within which they teach and conduct scholarship, then the
construct of shared governance within higher education is inevitably
undermined. Secondly, if faculty and academic decision-makers are not
intentional about equitable and ethical use of digital platforms within
higher education, students’ privacy and data is at risk. The
presentation will outline findings and frame datafication as a critical
change within higher education culture that could be addressed through a
sector-wide ethics approach.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> cognification, fourth industrial

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Over the past decade, opportunities for online learning have
dramatically increased. Learners around the world now have digital
access to a wide array of corporate trainings, certifications,
comprehensive academic degree programs, and other educational and
training options. Some organizations are blending traditional
instruction methods with online technologies. Blended learning generates
large volumes of data about both the content (quality and usage) and the
learners (study habits and learning outcomes). Correspondingly, the need
to properly process voluminous, continuous, and often disparate data has
prompted the advent of cognification. Cognification is the art of making
something increasingly, ethically, and regulatably smart. Cognification
techniques design complex data analytic models that allow natural
intelligence to engage artificial smartness in ways that can enhance the
learning experience. This panel will highlight how emerging trends in
cognification and the Fourth Industrial Revolution could disrupt online
education.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> e-text, recall, learning, navigation, OER,
reading, open educational resources</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>E-texts have many advantages over their paper counterparts,
especially when reflowable and available as open educational resources
(OERs). Unfortunately, research suggests that e-texts are, on the whole,
less memorable than p-texts, in part due to their relative lack of
visual navigational landmarks that help to anchor recall. The Landmarks
project team is, therefore, building an application that inserts
computer-generated artificial imperfections – abstract or
representational landmarks - into the display of e-texts, that remain
consistently associated with text passages even when documents are
reflowed or reformatted. We hypothesize that it may consequently be
easier to recall the associated contents. The application is designed to
provide the means to present modified open texts using a range of
generated landmarks and variations on them, and to test recall of the
content. In this initial pilot study, results of tests for readers
receiving different landmarks will be compared, with the intent of
identifying promising approaches to use for future studies.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>This talk introduces the work of the COPIM project (Community-Led
Infrastructures for Open Access Books), then elaborates on our project
of establishing the Open Book Collective and platform. The OBC, a
charitable entity, will host an infrastructure and revenue management
platform for the support, access, distribution and promotion of OA Books
beyond inequitable book processing models. We then discuss a revenue
model for publishers who wish to flip to an OA model without charging
BPCs. This ‘Opening the Future’ model has already been successfully
implemented by two publishers, the CEU Press and Liverpool University
Press.</p>
<p>We submit this proposal under the theme of sustaining positive
change. The international move towards OA book publishing, in alignment
with principles of cOAlition S, must be approached through models that
render OA books equitable and accessible to the widest variety of
international readers and authors. This necessitates thinking beyond BPC
and the potential monopolisation of the OA landscape by major
publishers, supporting a diversity of approaches in a networked model we
call ‘scaling small’.</p>

approaches to learning: Bridging inclusive/exclusive spaces through open
educational practice (Practice-Oriented)</strong></h4>
<p><em>Michelle Harrison (Thompson Rivers University)</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> open educational practice, flexibility</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, many educators have endeavoured to provide
flexible educational approaches in response to the constantly shifting
need for safe spaces and places for learning. For many the experiences
during the pandemic, including a shift to remote learning and constant
uncertainty, have highlighted ongoing digital inequities, and introduced
new ones. With a focus on student agency and knowledge co-creation, many
educators have looked to open educational practice (OEP), which often
uses networked and digital technologies, as one way to create more
inclusive and just learning experiences. But what does “engaging with
openness” look like in practice? How do we take a critical approach to
designing spaces that might help us meet the potential of OEP,
considering that openness can also introduce other aspects of closure?
In this presentation and conversation, I will use a spatial lens to
mediate a discussion on open approaches to education that can provide
more permeable access and flexibility for learners, but also critically
examine how these approaches introduce tensions though overabundance,
surveillance, and incursions on privacy.</p>

<p>This session is an exploration of stories and lived experiences with
opening the PhD and EdD process, presentations, and productions. Through
the metaphor of weaving on a loom, the stories from practitioners and
advocates of opening the dissertation are woven together through tension
and movement. The values and risks of opening the dissertation
incrementally change the fabric of the resulting tapestry. The nuanced
questions and decisions shuttle between the macro, meso, micro, and nano
levels. Decisional points are made by candidates in terms of where, when
and with whom to build relationships, join into professional
partnerships, enhance communications with media production tools, and
draw on the support of others to innovate and collaborate in order to
build knowledge. This presentation examines the granularities within the
warp and weft of weaving an open dissertation.</p>

<p>Our collaborative autoethnographic study (CAE) explores our use of
principles of open educational pedagogy (OEP) and co-mentorship to
enhance graduate teaching and learning. Working within an open, online
university, we are investigating the nature and extent to which we use
OEP and co-mentorship, and exploring the outcomes for ourselves and our
students. We seek to reduce hierarchical relationships, prioritizing
student-centred practices. We aim to improve ourselves as open, flexible
distance educators and to support successful student learning and
research. Consistent with CAE, we are collecting self-reflective and
dialogic data, and artefacts from our co-mentorship and open educational
practices. As participants in this study, we are experiencing the power
of CAE as a research method that moves us beyond traditional discourse
leading to personal and professional growth. We anticipate that our
research findings will help position our graduates and ourselves as
creative thinkers, learners, and contributors in the 21st century during
these times of critical change.</p>

<p>The practice of critical reflection should be infused into higher
education academic programs in order to sustain positive change in
masters and doctoral programs. Through this duoethnographic (Norris
&amp; Sawyer, 2012) examination of personal experiences in opening up
academia, the presenters will share insights, issues, and practices for
infusing reflexive practice through the use of blogging. The presenters
will share open reflective practices as evidenced throughout the
processes, productions, and presentations of their masters and PhD
scholarship. The presenters will showcase two different reflective
frameworks academics can employ in order to structure their own
self-reflective practices, including the 21st Century Educator framework
from Bates (2014) and the ORID reflective model from the Institute for
Cultural Affairs (2014). In light of the rapid and disruptive shifts to
online platforms resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, critical

<p>CURN (Canadian Undergraduate Research Network) is an emerging
community supported by the offices of Research and Graduate Studies and
Open Learning at Thompson Rivers University (TRU), which is located in
Secwepemcúl̓ecw on the unceded land of the Secwépemc peoples, on the
interior plateau of British Columbia.</p>
<p>For a number of years, groups of TRU students have been building a
CURN website as part of their undergraduate research ambassador roles,
adding to each other’s work every semester: curn.trubox.ca/.</p>
<p>Since the start of the initiative, the objective has been to create
an open resource that would get students interested and engaged in
undergraduate research.</p>
<p>Designed as an open pedagogy project, student research ambassadors
were given the autonomy to choose the format and the structure of the
resource, decide which topics to include, what they wanted to learn from
the project, and how to organize their groups and creative efforts.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>At a time of unprecedented change within the educational system due
to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Ontario Extend professional
learning program provides a platform for community, collaboration, and
digital fluency skill development amongst postsecondary educators across
the province of Ontario. A key driver for the Ontario Extend program is
to provide educators with the ability to leverage diverse educational
technology tools to create a more accessible learning environment for
students in online and hybrid learning environments.</p>
<p>The program framework builds upon “The 21st Century Educator” model
(Bates, 2016), which encompasses the knowledge, skills, and attitudes
identified as the foundational skills required to “thrive (and not just
survive) in a digital world” (Coldwell-Nelson, 2018; Martin &amp;
Grudziecki, 2006). Educators are encouraged to engage with six online
modules and reflect upon specific elements of their teaching practice.
Each of the six modules promotes a learning journey focused on a
combination of foundational upskilling and reskilling, with digital
badges awarded upon the completion of each module. Once an educator has
completed all six modules, they are awarded the Empowered Educator
micro-credential and join the growing community of Extend educators.
This session will provide an overview of the program and scaling efforts
to date, with time for questions.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>As the earth’s climate changes, the costs to communities in terms of
energy consumption and related financial expenses continue to increase.
Improving overall sustainability can occur by focusing on public schools
as energy generation sites and opportunities to model sustainable
communities for the world.The purpose of this session is to model
potential environmental and financial gains that may be expected to
contribute to improved sustainability that come from using rooftops and
other potentially unused public school community land. When coupled with
the use of sustainable building practices such as aquaculture and
permaculture, we demonstrate how this approach could generate needed
energy to make them more sustainable while also helping fund the
facilities to make the communities they serve more sustainable as well.
Such approaches may help reduce the negative impacts resulting from
rising, environmental change-fueled school expenses that require finding
new sources of revenue and savings.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>During the pandemic, two long-separate perspectives on digital
technologies and the work of higher education have become even more
distinct. This presentation will frame these distinctions in terms of
‘complicated’ and ‘complex’ domains, using Snowden &amp; Boone’s (2007)
Cynefin framework. The session will demonstrate how management
perspectives on higher education reflect complicated approaches to
problems in Cynefin terms. We will show how, in relation to educational
technology and online learning, complicated approaches obscure the
complexity of learning for claims of simple, technical answers, or what
Morozov (2013) calls ‘technosolutionism.’ We will suggest, on the other
hand, that critical pedagogies and open educational practices align with
what Cynefin calls the complex domain. Complex problems - like the human
problems of pedagogy and learning - cannot be solved with the
complicated approaches that technosolutionism lends itself to.
Post-pandemic, with the huge incursion technological platforms - and
promises - have made into higher education, choosing complicated
approaches to pedagogical problems risks failing to address the core
mission of teaching and learning entirely. Thus, we explore how to
distinguish between complicated and complex problems, and suggest
practices and pathways to allow higher education professionals to build
on the pandemic’s changes in positive ways.</p>

<p><em>Esteban Morales, Rachel Horst (University of British
Columbia)</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> imagination, technology, case study</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Discussions about technology are often rooted in a combination of
technological determinism, libertarianism, and free-market economics.
This growing trend prioritizes a vision of an optimistic future driven
by never-ending innovation. Nevertheless, this ideology is criticized as
it frequently favours some future visions over others—those of
entrepreneurs and investors over those of everybody else. Missing
perspectives include teachers and students, whose technological
environments are increasingly privatized and commercialized.
Accordingly, this presentation explores the possibilities of reimagining
the future of technology with students and teachers. To achieve this, we
present two case studies. The first case study explores the imagined
future of social media and violence with Colombian undergraduate
students, highlighting the possibilities to reach transformative
learning through imagination. The second case study explores a futures
literacies workshop in which teacher candidates critique the
technological futures embedded within a selection of cultural and
artistic texts. Overall, this presentation emphasizes the importance of
opening discussions of the future of technology to those involved in
educational settings.</p>

Educational Practices (OEP): Critical Policy Analysis in the Canadian

<p><em>Mara Bordignon (University of Western Ontario)</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> open educational practices, post-secondary
education, critical research, policy analysis</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Open educational practices (OEP) represent exciting possibilities for
social justice solutions to traditionally oppressive neoliberal
publishing systems and colonial practices. OEP is multidimensional
encapsulating both content, being open - data, educational resources,
science, source code, and systems, and processes such as open - access,
scholarship, learning, teaching, and pedagogy. OEP represents a shift
towards equitable models in rights, governance, infrastructure, and
funding, but is controversial in attempting to dismantle corporatized
power structures. Critical OEP research shows that open solutions may
not address some of the structural inequities, paradoxically
perpetuating market-based approaches.</p>
<p>Progress in OEP creation, adoption, and use in Canadian
post-secondary education (PSE) has occurred at a rapid rate. This paper
will provide a problem overview, with relevance to the Canadian OEP
field and policy landscape. The lack of policy is troubling so it will
be argued that understandings of OEP have not been critically analyzed
in national, provincial, and institutional policy. Looking at global
discourse documents guiding policy development should also be
scrutinized. Post-structuralism is critical framework that enables
questioning of the validity of existing political and corporate power
structures, along with critical approaches to policy analysis that can
interrogate the situatedness of OEP in current prevailing political
ideologies.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>While there has been a great deal of debate over the impact of online
and remote learning on mental health and well-being, there has been no
systematic syntheses or reviews of the research on this particular
issue. In this session, we will present a review of research on mental
health / well-being and online or remote learning. Our preliminary
analyses suggest that little scholarship existed prior to 2020 and that
most of these studies have been conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
We report three findings: (a) it’s very difficult, if not impossible, to
control for pandemic effects in the data, (b) studies present a very
mixed picture, with variability around how mental health and well-being
are measured and how / whether any causal inferences are made in
relation to online and remote learning, and (c) results across these
studies are extremely mixed. Based on this study, we suggest that
researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and administrators exercise
extreme caution around making generalizable assertions with respect to
the impacts of online/remote learning and mental health.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: education, post-secondary, online

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>The Liberated Learner, funded by the eCampusOntario Virtual Learning
Strategy, is an inter-institutional collaboration that brings together
student co-designers and elearning professionals. This open resource
consists of four modules that mirror the Ontario Extend for Educators
modules (Lopes &amp; Porter, 2018), but are customised to the learner
context. These modules are Learner (learning strategies), Technologist
(digital fluency skills), Collaborator (communication, group work,
community member), &amp; Navigator (curating, fact checking, other
scholarly skills). The goal is to provide learners a similar opportunity
to gain confidence and independence in their post-secondary experience
online.</p>
<p>Recognizing that most issues post-secondary students face are complex
and ill-structured (Cormier, 2021), the design and development of the
Liberated Learner open modules were primarily student-led. During a
week-long design sprint, 120 students generated 99 wicked problems. This
collection of personal stories document students’ real life
post-secondary challenges. These stories then informed the content of
the 4 modules as they were developed together with student co-designers
from each institution. They also provided a pathway into the Liberated
Leaner modular support at multiple levels of experience (beginner,
intermediate, advanced). Each module also consists of a student created
Beats to Study to intro to help learners get into the learning
groove.</p>

Metaphor in Scholarly Communication: A Brief Inventory and
Inspection</h4>
<p><em>AJ Boston</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: scholarly communication, metaphor,
analogy, open access</p>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Practitioners in information-centered fields regularly use metaphors
in the professional literature and in everyday use. Many of these are
based on land use or a general understanding of the natural sciences,
and sometimes (but not always) relate to a broader metaphorical concept
of information ecology or information ecosystem. Discourse in fields
like scholarly communication is no exception. What I recommend in this
presentation is that we begin to take inventory of our earthly metaphors
in scholarly communication. Then, through a deliberate inspection of our
metaphorical concepts, we can check whether the assumptions each implies
are consistent with our values and do not lead us to draw false,
misleading, or premature conclusions. In recognizing the usefulness and
effect of metaphors, we should seek to replace old ones when they cease
to bear wise fruit.</p>

<p><em>Matt Bower</em></p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Online Learning, COVID-19,
Technology-Mediated Learning Theory, Comprehensive Evaluation of the Use

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the rapid transformation of education
worldwide, catapulting technology in some people’s eyes from being the
villain of education to the hero. As international education returns to
some degree of normalcy, what can we really learn from the COVID-19
experience? This presentation using Technology Mediated Learning Theory
and the Comprehensive Evaluation and Use of Technology In Education
framework to identify what we can, and cannot learn, based on the
argument that the COVID-19 pandemic has been, and can only ever be, an
educational context. Identifying the attributes of the COVID-19 context,
and how those attributes have shaped education, can then provide
insights that may in turn be transferred to other times, places, and
people. The increased role of parents in the education of children is
taken as a case in point, with data revealing how the design of online
learning should be changed to account for parental knowledge,
responsibilities, perspectives and preferences. Implications for the
design and study of online learning are discussed.</p>

All OTESSA Participants can attend the [Congress “Big Thinking” lecture series](https://www.federationhss.ca/en/congress/congress-2022/open-programming). These take place each day of the conference. Congress has [“open events”](https://www.federationhss.ca/en/congress/congress-2022/calendar-open-events) available as well (open to registrants across association conferences at Congress as well as those who hold community passes).

All OTESSA Registrants can also attend conference sessions offered by the [Canadian Association for the Study of Education (CSSE)](https://csse-scee.ca/), [Canadian Association for the Study of Higher Education (CSSHE)](https://csshe-scees.ca/), and [Canadian Association of Learned Journals (CALJ)](https://www.calj-acrs.ca/) as we have reciprocity agreements in place. Please note that presenters must register in each conference in which they are presenting.

Join us at the #OTESSA23 Morning Radio Show every morning times TBA (Eastern) at [https://voiced.ca/](https://voiced.ca/)
